# PWA Setup for Border Region Story Map

## What We've Implemented

### 1. **Web App Manifest** (`public/manifest.json`)
- App name: "Border Region Story Map"
- Short name: "StoryMap"
- Standalone display mode (looks like a native app)
- Icons using the existing globe.svg
- Theme colors matching the app design

### 2. **Service Worker** (Auto-generated by next-pwa)
- Handles offline functionality
- Caches map tiles for offline access
- Manages app updates and caching strategies
- Auto-registers on app load

### 3. **Install Prompt** (`components/InstallPrompt.tsx`)
- Shows users they can install the app
- Appears when the app meets PWA criteria
- Allows users to add to home screen
- Handles install flow gracefully

### 4. **PWA Configuration** (`next.config.ts`)
- Integrated next-pwa for service worker generation
- Configured caching strategies for map tiles
- Optimized for static export (GitHub Pages)

### 5. **Meta Tags & Viewport** (`app/layout.tsx`)
- Proper PWA meta tags for all platforms
- Apple-specific meta tags for iOS
- Viewport configuration for mobile optimization

## PWA Features Now Available

**Installable** - Users can add to home screen  
**Offline Capable** - Service worker caches resources  
**App-like Experience** - Standalone display mode

## Next Steps for Enhanced PWA Features

### Voice Recognition

## Testing PWA Features

1. **Install Test**: Open in Chrome, look for install button
2. **Offline Test**: Disconnect internet, refresh page
3. **Service Worker**: Check DevTools > Application > Service Workers
4. **Manifest**: Check DevTools > Application > Manifest

## Deployment

The PWA will work automatically when deployed to GitHub Pages. The service worker will be generated in the `public/` folder during build.

## Browser Support

- **Chrome/Edge**: Full PWA support
- **Firefox**: Good PWA support
- **Safari**: Limited PWA support (no service worker)
- **Mobile**: Excellent PWA support on Android, good on iOS
